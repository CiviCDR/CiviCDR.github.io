CiviCDR is housed between Small Media and ASL 19. We work with a community of digital security service providers and rapid responders to help protect defined communities of NGOs. We are guided by our Advisory Committee, which is made up of partner organisations, digital security experts and others working on rapid response. You can read about our approach in the documents below.
